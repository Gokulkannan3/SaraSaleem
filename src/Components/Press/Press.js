            In the Middle East, much of the world's attention is on the conflict in Gaza and appropriately so. But other challenges remain. In Iraq, where American military forces liberated the country from the evil clutches of Saddam Hussein just a few years ago, the independence of an American ally is increasingly in doubt. Iranian sympathizers exist at all levels of Iraqi's government bureaucracy and legal system.

            The aftermath of war is often measured not only in the lives lost and infrastructure destroyed, but in the invisible dangers that persist long after the final shots are fired. In the South Caucasus, the region of Karabakh, internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, remains one of the most heavily mined areas in the world.

            An Iraqi Catholic leader has strongly denied an allegation of complicity in the 2014 kidnapping of a businesswoman, after a lawsuit filed this month in a U.S. court. The complaint, filed Feb. 13 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleges that Archbishop Bashar Warda "facilitated, through his connections to Iran-backed militias such as Rayan al Kildani's Babylon Brigades, the scheme to extort, kidnap, torture, and attempt to kill" the plaintiff, Sara Saleem.

            Archbishop Bashar Warda said it was 'shameful and disgraceful to suggest that I am using the Vatican as a reference to influence a judicial decision'. A Kurdish-American businesswoman who has made allegations of corruption against Archbishop Bashar Warda of Erbil said the Vatican should suspend him and launch its own investigation.

            Since the demise of strongman Saddam Hussein, it is fair to say that Iraq's judicial system has undergone significant changes. At first, says a new report from the Iraq Watch Group of the Middle East Centre of the London School of Economics (LSE), the reforms appeared to create a more independent judiciary. However, the truth quickly emerged that it has instead become increasingly centralized and politicized.

            I often find myself reflecting on the course my life has taken—especially since my long and ongoing battle against a corrupt judicial system in Iraq began more than a decade ago. What began as a dream to contribute to Iraq's growth and recovery gradually morphed into a nightmare—one in which my efforts were systematically dismantled by those in power.
